 # AutoComplete-and-text-generation

This repo consists of two projects.
1) Text Generator: In this code, the program asks the user to enter a few lines and number of words to predict. Based on the lines provided, it will auto generate text for the next n words(where n is the number of words entered by user). To run this , clone the repo and download all requirements. Then run app.py in terminal and paste the link in browser.

2) Text Completor : This project works similar to the suggestions feature in your mobile keyboard. As you enter a text , the program prompts three possible words to follow your entered text. This works as a suggestion/auto complete. To run this, clone the repo and run autocomplete.py. Remebmber to not press enter at any point as enter is used to quit the porgram. As you enter a space after text, program will provide you with suggestions. To use first suggestion , press tab. I am still working to imporve suggestions and ways to select the remaining two suggestions.
